<p align="justify" > Greetings, fellow data enthusiasts! I'm Jafar Sharif Shaik, a self-proclaimed data nerd who thrives on wrangling massive datasets, optimizing pipelines, and automating workflows. If there's a way to make data move faster, cleaner, and smarter, you can bet I'm already on it.</p>

<p align="justify" > With over 7 years of experience as a Data Analyst/Engineer, I specialize in building end-to-end analytics solutions that drive business impact. From ETL/ELT and data warehousing to modeling, governance, and visualization, I ensure data is structured, scalable, and actionable. Proficient in SQL, Airflow, Dagster, Spark, AWS, and Python, I excel in automating near-real-time analytics workflows. I see data engineering as both a science and an artâ€”optimizing workflows, creating reliable pipelines, and transforming raw data into business value. If you're looking for someone to turn raw data into pure analytical gold, letâ€™s connect and make data magic happen! </p>
